# miniRT
## RayTracing project

The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a
scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

### To compile miniRT:
- `make`

### Executable:
- `./minirt [arg]`
 > *arg: a scene in format *.rt
 
### Graphics library used:
- miniLibx (https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

### To compile miniLibx:
- https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html#installation

### Program's OS Compatibility:
- Linux
- macOS
